# Scanline based point cloud segmentation and subsampling approach for fast classification

## Conda environment installation 

To install the conda environment used for the project, run the following command in the command line (project directory level):

> conda env create -f conda_env.yml

This will create a new conda environment called 'scanline_segmentation' with all the necessary dependencies for this project. Most packages were installed using pip as the package manager. For packages that failed to install with pip, conda was used. The python version is 3.10. 

To activate the environment, run:

> conda activate scanline_segmentation
